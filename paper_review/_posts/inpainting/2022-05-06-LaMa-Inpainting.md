# LaMa (Large Mask) Inpainting

* toc
{:toc}

## Introduction
Discussion regarding global context in inpainting problems have dominated research in recent years.
Inpainting models are required to maintain both detailed local texture and consistent global structure.
Recent models adapt various methods to achieve the goal. 
Among them, large mask inpainting (LaMa) models opt unique methods and so outperform state of the arts.

## Method
The authors insists that wide receptive field in early stage of the model is crucial for the model to effectively learn global structures.
The authors adapt the following 3 methods to make LaMa models learn global structures.

### Fast Fourier Convolution
Convolution layer with Fast Fourier operation helps 

### Loss Functions

### Mask Generation
