## Why neovim?

Many developers use vscode as their primary development ide (or just text editor).
Although vscode and it's extensive features are already fascinating, vim users (i.e. vimmers)
hope to meet their keyboard driven workflow in VSCode.
Thanks to some developers, there are two options;
 [`VSCodeVim`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) and
 [`VSCode Neovim`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)
(there might be other options that I didn't aware of)
  
I've used `VSCodeVim` for a while, and the experience was great.
But, I finally fall into `VSCode Neovim`.
Since `VSCode Neovim` is not emulating vim features in VSCode, but rather connects real Neovim buffer
and VSCode editor.
Therefore, the extension requires preinstalled Neovim and it's path.
Although `VSCodeVim` is bigger project and more stable than `VSCode Neovim`,
`VSCode Neovim` is very flexible, and customizable thanks to its unique approach.
Users can utilize existing configurations, and plugins for their Neovim, which is true integration.
